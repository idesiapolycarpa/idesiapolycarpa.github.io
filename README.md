This is a GitHub account I created since I was locked out of the one I previously used. I intend to use this one long-term. 

This repository was created for my CTI 110 course. 

This respository was cloned to my local PC that I use for school using the GitHub Desktop application. I simply cloned the respository from the web to my local PC at C:\Users\ncsma\Documents\GitHub\idesiapolycarpa.github.io

I am editing this file in VSCode, but I will need to use the GitHub application to push changes as specified in the assignment.
